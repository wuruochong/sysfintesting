PROPOSAL

RPG

Elements of the project:

-A terminal session where a player can chat with other party members or input commands
    a)The program will recognize a command by checking if there is a special character in the first index of the input (such as a colon)
    b)Inputs without special characters will print as a normal message
        Example:
        Ricky types "heal me"
        Kevin types "no"
        Kevin types "/use 1 2"
        Ricky types "i hate you"
        
        Display:
        [Ricky] heal me
        [Kevin] no
        <Kevin> used Heal on <Matthew>!
        [Ricky] i hate you
        
-A terminal session that displays sprites, player statistics, and move choices
    a)Will be linked to the chat terminal through PIPES
    b)Utilizes a HANDSHAKE to make sure the two terminals are connected
    c)Makes decisions based on the output recieved from the chat terminal
    
-Party members will be linked through NETWORKING
    a)every player's display terminal will update every time a move is made
        -this will be done through network semaphores (IF WE CAN) or just through 
        while checks that will make progress, will look into doing this through
        some kind of overnetwork shared memory, or merely through read/writes 
        which will be be a burden on the smooth gameplay experience we aim to create

-GUI is comprised of two windows, one will be the aforementioned terminal and the
other will be a terminal or a sdl window used purely as a graphical utility.

-MECHANICS
    -Party System
        -Players can form parties in the lobby
        -Party leader has the party powers: kick, delegate, etc.
    
    -Ready System
        -The party leader can enter the dungeon after all the players are ready
    
    -Friend System(perhaps)
    
    -Dungeon-based Experience
        -dungeons will be replayable
        -the player must beat the lower-difficulty dungeons to access more difficult ones
    
    -Progression
        -Players will get stronger through their SKILLS
        -There are no LEVELS or STATS
        -We may take this in two different directions
            -Mastery System in which players can use and switch between any skills (in Lobby)
            -Path System in which players choose to upgrade their skills at junctions (loses other option)
